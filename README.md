# AngularJS MultiSelect

Forked from https://github.com/isteven/angular-multi-select, with the following changes:
 - Changed CSS to be more inline with default Bootstrap (multi-select height @ 34px, width @ 100%)
 - Added showSelectedText binding via https://github.com/isteven/angular-multi-select/issues/424
 - Expanded showSelectedText binding to include (# of items selected)
